Learning AI-ML: 

I want to learn about AI-ML application development frameworks and workflows.
 
I am using a Ubuntu 24.04 Desktop with CPU only. In terms of software setup, as much as possible I like to use docker and or python virtual environments.
 
Very first I will like to know about 10 most commonly used open-source models and associated datasets used in the industry for the purpose of learning and illustrating key ML concepts in an incremental manner.

**10 Commonly Used Open-Source Models & Datasets for AI/ML Learning**

This list provides a good starting point for learning AI/ML concepts with readily available open-source models and datasets:

**1. Image Classification:**

* **Model:** **ResNet-18** (A popular convolutional neural network architecture)
* **Dataset:** **ImageNet** (Massive image dataset with over 14 million images and 22,000 categories)
    * **Key Concepts:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), image preprocessing, transfer learning, model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall)

**2. Natural Language Processing (NLP):**

* **Model:** **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) 
* **Dataset:** **GLUE Benchmark** (Collection of diverse NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, question answering)
    * **Key Concepts:** Transformers, attention mechanisms, NLP preprocessing (tokenization, stemming), fine-tuning pre-trained models

**3. Object Detection:**

* **Model:** **YOLOv5** (Real-time object detection algorithm)
* **Dataset:** **COCO** (Common Objects in Context) - Large dataset with images containing everyday objects 
    * **Key Concepts:** Object localization, bounding boxes, non-maximum suppression, anchor boxes

**4. Time Series Forecasting:**

* **Model:** **ARIMA** (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) 
* **Dataset:** **Sunspots** (Historical sunspot data)
    * **Key Concepts:** Time series analysis, stationarity, forecasting techniques, model evaluation (MAE, RMSE)

**5. Recommendation Systems:**

* **Model:** **Collaborative Filtering (e.g., Matrix Factorization)** 
* **Dataset:** **MovieLens** (User ratings for movies)
    * **Key Concepts:** User-item interactions, latent factors, collaborative filtering vs. content-based filtering

**6. Anomaly Detection:**

* **Model:** **Isolation Forest** (Anomaly detection algorithm based on decision trees)
* **Dataset:** **KDD Cup 1999** (Network intrusion detection dataset)
    * **Key Concepts:** Outlier detection, novelty detection, feature engineering for anomaly detection

**7. Reinforcement Learning:**

* **Model:** **CartPole** (Classic control problem in OpenAI Gym)
* **Dataset:** **(Generated during training)** - No external dataset, learn from environment interactions
    * **Key Concepts:** Agents, environments, rewards, exploration vs. exploitation, Q-learning

**8. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):**

* **Model:** **DCGAN** (Deep Convolutional GANs)
* **Dataset:** **CelebA** (Celebrities in the Wild) - Dataset of celebrity faces
    * **Key Concepts:** Generator and discriminator networks, adversarial training, generating synthetic data

**9. Clustering:**

* **Model:** **K-Means** (Simple and popular clustering algorithm)
* **Dataset:** **Iris** (Classic dataset for classification with three flower species)
    * **Key Concepts:** Clustering algorithms, distance metrics (Euclidean distance), evaluation (silhouette score)

**10. Decision Trees:**

* **Model:** **Decision Tree Classifier** 
* **Dataset:** **UCI Machine Learning Repository** (Contains numerous datasets, choose one like the "Wine" dataset)
    * **Key Concepts:** Decision trees, information gain, feature importance, overfitting

**Software Setup Recommendations (Docker & Python Virtual Environments)**

* **Docker:**
    * Create a Dockerfile for each project to ensure reproducibility and consistent environments.
    * Use Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications (if needed).
    * Example Dockerfile (for a Python project with specific dependencies):

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim-buster

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "your_script.py"] 
```

* **Python Virtual Environments:**
    * Create a virtual environment for each project using `venv`:

```bash
python3 -m venv my_project_env
source my_project_env/bin/activate
```

    * Install project-specific dependencies within the activated environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This approach helps to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts between different projects.

**Learning Approach**

* **Start with simpler models and datasets (e.g., Iris, MNIST).** 
* **Gradually increase complexity.**
* **Focus on understanding the underlying concepts.**
* **Experiment with different hyperparameters and model architectures.**
* **Utilize visualization techniques to understand model behavior.**
* **Use online resources (tutorials, documentation, research papers) to learn and explore.**

Remember to adapt this list and approach to your specific learning goals and interests.
