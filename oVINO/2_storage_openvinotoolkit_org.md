## prompt
help me understand this repo https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/
please parse each of the directories and explain the contents there

## response

The repository at `https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/` contains various directories and files related to the OpenVINO Toolkit.

Based on the summary, the repository includes:

Directories: test_data, data, deployment_archives, models_contrib, wheels, repositories, dependencies, and drivers.

Based on the information gathered, here's an explanation of the likely contents of each directory in the OpenVINO storage repository:

* **test_data:** This directory serves as the OpenVINO™ Test Data Repository. It holds data essential for successfully running OpenVINO tests, including test models, image data, XML files for Inference Engine Class tests, and weights for VPU tests.

* **data:** While the specific contents weren't precisely defined in the search results, this directory may contain general data files or components included in the OpenVINO Runtime archives.

* **deployment_archives:** This directory likely hosts pre-built components and code samples related to building and deploying AI solutions with the OpenVINO Toolkit, possibly including archives from related GitHub repositories focused on deployment.

* **models_contrib:** This directory on the storage site is expected to contain models or components from the `openvino_contrib` repository. This repository is dedicated to extra modules and contributed functionalities for OpenVINO, such as community-developed plugins and APIs.

* **wheels:** This directory contains Python wheel packages for various OpenVINO components, such as `openvino-tokenizers`. These packages are used for easy installation of OpenVINO libraries and tools using the pip package installer.

* **repositories:** This directory might contain archives or builds of various OpenVINO-related GitHub repositories, providing snapshots or specific versions of these projects.

* **dependencies:** This directory likely stores external software dependencies required for building and running OpenVINO components, such as libraries needed for the Intel-optimized build of the OpenCV library, the Deep Learning Inference Engine, and the Model Optimizer tools.

* **drivers:** This directory probably contains driver-related files or packages necessary for OpenVINO to effectively utilize specific hardware, such as Intel GPUs, by providing the required driver components.
